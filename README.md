# Welcome to Littleclone's C Compression Project

Hello! I'm Littleclone, and I've recently started writing my projects in C. This project is a hobby project, initially created to help me understand C better. It is not intended to be a performant compression algorithm. However, it handles English text quite well, compressing and decompressing it effectively. That said, it is not free of bugs and should not be considered a serious project. I will work on it when I have the time and interest, but currently, my focus is on other C projects.

## Reporting Issues or Suggestions
If you find a bug or have an optimization idea, feel free to open an issue. Please keep in mind that this is a hobby project and may not receive significant attention from me. Updates will happen occasionally as I focus on other projects in C.

## Usage
- The program will ask you for the complete path to the file, which must include the file extension (currently, it only supports `.txt` files; see `FileManager.c` for details).
- You can choose between compression and decompression.
- The operation will overwrite the original file, so please be cautious.

You are free to modify this project as you wish. However, please retain the copyright notice and include a note crediting this project to me. For convenience, the project can be quickly set up using Visual Studio:
